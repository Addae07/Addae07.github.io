<p>Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, William “Addae” Lawrence III began his dance training at the Nashville School of the Arts. He continued studying dance and theatre at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, TN where he received a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies with a focus in Dance and Theatre. He has traveled to South Africa and Ghana, West Africa for student exchange programs to study drum and dance in the African culture. He has been apart of Hayiya West African Dance Ensemble. I always loved computers and wanted to learn more which has lead me to study coding. Looking forward to learning more since technology is the way of the future.</p>
