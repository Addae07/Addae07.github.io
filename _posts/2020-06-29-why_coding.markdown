I decided to get into coding a year ago while studying I.T. I have always been the go to person in the family and at work when it came to technology. This is what lead me to learning more about I.T. in additon to I was tired of being the face of hospitality and wanted to go behind the scenes and be apart of the reason things kept going. Would love to stay within the hospitality field though. I have been in hospitality for ten years. 

I want to learn more about coding due to it is a great field to be in and I can see the need. I have became aapart of a few organizations that need website and I think it would be amazing to create an app for these organizations. 
Technology in any form is the way of the future and its a great career move. I am sure job security wouldnt be much of an issue if I was already in coding prior to Covid 19. Covid 19 defintely made me rethink my career. Due to being furlough I figured now was the best time to complete this course and a full time pace.
